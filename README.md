This is a simple demo for Singleton Design Pattern, built for educational purposes.

In this scenario, my application is using a logger. For obvious reasons, it should not have multiple logger instances.
Singleton pattern brings an elegant solution for that.

There are 2 versions.
The first one is naive and does not cover multi-threading scenarios.
The second one is written in a thread-safe fashion.
